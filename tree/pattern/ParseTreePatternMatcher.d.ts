/**
 * A tree pattern matching mechanism for ANTLR {@link ParseTree}s.
 *
 * Patterns are strings of source input text with special tags representing
 * token or rule references such as:
 *
 * ```
 * <ID> = <expr>;
 * ```
 *
 * Given a pattern start rule such as `statement`, this object constructs
 * a {@link ParseTree} with placeholders for the `ID` and `expr`
 * subtree. Then the {@link #match} routines can compare an actual
 * {@link ParseTree} from a parse with this pattern. Tag `<ID>` matches
 * any `ID` token and tag `<expr>` references the result of the
 * `expr` rule (generally an instance of `ExprContext`.
 *
 * Pattern `x = 0;` is a similar pattern that matches the same pattern
 * except that it requires the identifier to be `x` and the expression to
 * be `0`.
 *
 * The {@link #matches} routines return `true` or `false` based
 * upon a match for the tree rooted at the parameter sent in. The
 * {@link #match} routines return a {@link ParseTreeMatch} object that
 * contains the parse tree, the parse tree pattern, and a map from tag name to
 * matched nodes (more below). A subtree that fails to match, returns with
 * {@link ParseTreeMatch#mismatchedNode} set to the first tree node that did not
 * match.
 *
 * For efficiency, you can compile a tree pattern in string form to a
 * {@link ParseTreePattern} object.
 *
 * See `TestParseTreeMatcher` for lots of examples.
 * {@link ParseTreePattern} has two static helper methods:
 * {@link ParseTreePattern#findAll} and {@link ParseTreePattern#match} that
 * are easy to use but not super efficient because they create new
 * {@link ParseTreePatternMatcher} objects each time and have to compile the
 * pattern in string form before using it.
 *
 * The lexer and parser that you pass into the {@link ParseTreePatternMatcher}
 * constructor are used to parse the pattern in string form. The lexer converts
 * the `<ID> = <expr>;` into a sequence of four tokens (assuming lexer
 * throws out whitespace or puts it on a hidden channel). Be aware that the
 * input stream is reset for the lexer (but not the parser; a
 * {@link ParserInterpreter} is created to parse the input.). Any user-defined
 * fields you have put into the lexer might get changed when this mechanism asks
 * it to scan the pattern string.
 *
 * Normally a parser does not accept token `<expr>` as a valid
 * `expr` but, from the parser passed in, we create a special version of
 * the underlying grammar representation (an {@link ATN}) that allows imaginary
 * tokens representing rules (`<expr>`) to match entire rules. We call
 * these *bypass alternatives*.
 *
 * Delimiters are `<`} and `>`}, with `\` as the escape string
 * by default, but you can set them to whatever you want using
 * {@link #setDelimiters}. You must escape both start and stop strings
 * `\<` and `\>`.
